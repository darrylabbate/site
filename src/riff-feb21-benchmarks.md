I regularly benchmark [Riff](https://riff.cx) as I implement new
features into the language or new optimizations for the VM. These
benchmarks are very useful for finding incorrect and/or
poorly-performing parts of the interpreter.

## Notable Recent Improvements

The implementation of [computed
goto](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2012/07/12/computed-goto-for-efficient-dispatch-tables/)
in Riff's virtual machine sparked a significant overall performance
boost for programs which relied heavily on VM control flow (recursive
Fibonacci and Ackermann programs are good examples). Before, the
interpreter loop was a standard giant `switch`-`case` construct inside
a `while` loop[^1].

[^1]: It still is, actually, if the compiler doesn't support GNU C
  extensions

| Program     | Before | After  | Î”           |
| -------     | ------ | -----  | -           |
| `fib(35)`   | 0.638s | 0.541s | **-15.21%** |
| `ack(3,10)` | 1.146s | 0.791s | **-30.98%** |
| `s-n(500)`  | 0.615s | 0.522s | **-15.12%** |

These improvements line up with the improvements noted in Eli
Bendersky's blog post.

> I did some simple benchmarking with random opcodes and the `goto` version is 25% faster than the `switch` version.

> Comments inside the CPython implementation note that using computed goto made the Python VM 15-20% faster

## Methodology

Programs were benchmarked on a 2018 Mac mini with a 3.0 GHz 6-core
processor and 32GB of 2667 MHz DDR4 RAM. Programs were timed using the
builtin shell utility `time`. Each program was run ten times, with the
best time being kept.

`riff` was compiled with Apple clang 12.0 (`clang-1200.0.32.27`) with
`-O3` optimizations enabled.

| Interpreter | Version  | Source                            |
| ----------- | -------  | ------                            |
| Lua         | 5.4.2    | Homebrew-installed                |
| LuaJIT      | 2.0.5    | Homebrew-installed                |
| Ruby        | 2.6.3p62 | Default interpreter on macOS 11.2 |

## Programs Used

Recursive Fibonacci (Lua)

```lua
function fib(n)
  if n < 2 then
    return n
  end
  return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
end
print(fib(35))
```

Recursive Fibonacci (Riff)

```riff
fn fib(n) {
    return n < 2 ? n : fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
}
fib(35)
```

Recursive Fibonacci (Ruby)

```ruby
def fib(n)
  if n < 2 then
    n
  else
    fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
  end
end
puts fib(35)
```

Ackermann (Lua)

```lua
function ack(M,N)
  if M == 0 then return N + 1 end
  if N == 0 then return ack(M-1,1) end
  return ack(M-1,ack(M, N-1))
end
print(ack(3,10))
```

Ackermann (Riff)

```riff
fn ack(m, n) {
    if m == 0
        return n + 1
    elif n == 0
        return ack(m-1, 1)
    else
        return ack(m-1, ack(m, n-1))
}
ack(3,10)
```

Ackermann (Ruby)

```ruby
def ack(m, n)
  if m == 0
    n + 1
  elsif n == 0
    ack(m-1, 1)
  else
    ack(m-1, ack(m, n-1))
  end
end
puts ack(3,10)
```

Spectral norm (Riff)

```riff
fn A(i, j) {
    local ij = i+j
    return 1.0 / (ij*(ij+1)/2+i+1)
}

fn Av(x, y, N) {
    for i in N-1 {
        local a = 0
        for j in N-1
            a += x[j] * A(i, j)
        y[i] = a
    }
}

fn Atv(x, y, N) {
    for i in N-1 {
        local a = 0
        for j in N-1
            a += x[j] * A(j, i)
        y[i] = a
    }
}

fn AtAv(x, y, t, N) {
    Av(x, t, N)
    Atv(t, y, N)
}

local u = {},
      v = {},
      t = {},
      N = $1 ? num($1) : 100

for i in N-1
    u[i] = 1

for i in 9 {
    AtAv(u, v, t, N)
    AtAv(v, u, t, N)
}

local vBv = 0, vv = 0
for i in N-1 {
    local vi = v[i]
    vBv += u[i] * vi
    vv  += vi * vi
}

fmt("%0.9f", sqrt(vBv / vv))
```
