I regularly benchmark [Riff](https://riff.cx) as I implement new
features into the language or new optimizations for the VM. These
benchmarks are very useful for finding incorrect and/or
poorly-performing parts of the interpreter.

## Notable Recent Improvements

The implementation of [computed
goto](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2012/07/12/computed-goto-for-efficient-dispatch-tables/)
in Riff's virtual machine sparked a significant overall performance
boost for programs which relied heavily on VM control flow (recursive
Fibonacci and Ackermann programs are good examples). Before, the
interpreter loop was a standard giant `switch`-`case` construct inside
a `while` loop[^1].

[^1]: It still is, actually, if the compiler doesn't support GNU C
  extensions

| Program     | Before | After  | Î”           |
| -------     | ------ | -----  | -           |
| `fib(35)`   | 0.638s | 0.541s | **-15.21%** |
| `ack(3,10)` | 1.146s | 0.791s | **-30.98%** |
| `s-n(500)`  | 0.615s | 0.522s | **-15.12%** |

These improvements line up with the improvements noted in Eli
Bendersky's blog post.

> I did some simple benchmarking with random opcodes and the `goto` version is 25% faster than the `switch` version.

> Comments inside the CPython implementation note that using computed goto made the Python VM 15-20% faster

## Notes

Programs were benchmarked on a 2018 Mac mini with a 3.0 GHz 6-core
processor and 32GB of 2667 MHz DDR4 RAM.

`riff` was compiled with Apple clang 12.0 (`clang-1200.0.32.27`) with
`-O3` optimizations enabled.
