I’m a self-taught programmer from New Orleans, LA; currently studying Computer
Science at the University of New Orleans. I enjoy using and building
command-line interfaces, especially ones involving curl (try curl darryl.sh). I
also dabble in web development & design, as well as graphic design.

Other interests of mine include cooking and playing guitar & piano. I actually
spent the past 7 years working as a professional chef in various New Orleans
restaurants and catering companies.
