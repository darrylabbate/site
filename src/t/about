    ( See fuller version at https://darryl.sh )

    I dabble in all kinds of computer stuff; from graphic design
    to software development. Yes I built a plain-text version of 
    my website.

━━━ Tools ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

    macOS, Bash, Haskell, Vim, Git, Sass, Adobe apps, probably more.
