# Darryl Abbate

I'm a self-taught programmer from New Orleans, LA; currently studying Computer Science at the University of New Orleans. I enjoy using and building command-line interfaces, especially ones involving `curl` (try `curl darryl.sh`). I also dabble in web development & design, as well as graphic design.

Other interests of mine include cooking and playing guitar & piano. I actually spent the past 7 years working as a professional chef in various New Orleans restaurants and catering companies.
